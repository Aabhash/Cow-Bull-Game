#COW-BULL GAME
Paper based cow-bull game converted to a windows-based application. 

#Getting Started
The game is simple yet logical. The player needs to guess a four digit number. Based on the guess, the rightmost partition shows upto what extent the player's guess is correct. The result is shown as in numbers of cows and bulls- thus the name. A player gets a fair amount of six guesses for each four digit number.

To understand what cows and bulls mean in the context of the game, all you need to do is hover on the jumping cow and bull on the start page of the game.
